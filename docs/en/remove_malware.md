## Remove Malware

> Guide on how to remove malware

- Download and install [Malwarebytes][1] to scan malware. 
    - If you have file infector malware, [use Dr.Web][2] to scan it. 
- Quarantine the detected malware.
- Removing malware **won't fix the damage done by the malware**.
- To fix your system, **[clean install Windows](./clean_install_windows)** as per guides.

::: tip After you remove malware

- After you remove malware and reinstall Windows, change your passwords for all your accounts.
- If you want to find safe software and games and avoid malware, check out [fmhy.net][3].

- Antimalware can remove most of the malware but can not undo all the damage done by the malware in the system.   
  - For example, malware can infect system files, damage Windows updates and security and important registries, or even hide the malware somewhere antimalware can not find.  
- Due to this reason, in the event of a malware infection, you must perform a [clean installation of the system](./clean_install_windows) using a bootable USB drive and formatting the C drive and EFI/System partitions. (Do not use the reset option, malware can persist in that case).
