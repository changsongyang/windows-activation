::: info Notes

::: details Click here to see the details

- **For Windows:** I personally use the **KMS method** [[see guides](./kms)] or [[Online KMS](./online_kms) for my Windows 10/11 activations. It's official, leaves no files on the system, and takes less than 3 minutes. If for some reason that fails, HWID is my go-to, as it's also official and file-less.
- **For Office:** I use Ohook, or TSforge, The small differences are noted in the [summary table 👆🏿](#activation-methods-summary)

## How to Remove Activations
::: danger Additional Information

::: details See details

- **HWID:**
  A digital license is stored on Microsoft's servers and tied to your hardware. It cannot be "removed" in the traditional sense. A major hardware change (like the motherboard) will invalidate it. To return to an unactivated state, you can install a generic KMS key. [Extended hwid details](./hwid#how-to-remove-hwid)
- **Online KMS / Ohook / KMS38:**
   Use the corresponding "Uninstall" or "Remove" option within the MAS script menu, then run the "Fix Licensing" option from the Troubleshoot menu. [Online KMS Details](./online_kms#how-to-remove-online-kms) and [KMS38 details](./kms38#how-to-remove-kms38)
- **TSforge:**
  This method only appends data and doesn't install files. To reset it, simply run the "Fix Licensing" option from the Troubleshoot menu in the MAS script. [Ohook](./ohook#how-to-remove-ohook) [TSforge details](./tsforge#how-to-remove-tsforge)
