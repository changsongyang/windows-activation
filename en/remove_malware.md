> [!NOTE]  
>  
> - Antimalware can remove most of the malware but can not undo all the damage done by the malware in the system.   
    - For example, malware can infect system files, damage Windows updates and security and important registries, or even hide the malware somewhere antimalware can not find.   
> - Due to this reason, in the event of a malware infection,
> - you must perform a [clean installation of the system](clean_install_windows.md) using a bootable USB drive and formatting the C drive and EFI/System partitions. (Do not use the reset option, malware can persist in that case.)
